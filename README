Welcome to my simulator for various dice rolling scenarios. 

In fedora you will need the following:
  dnf group install "Development Tools" "C Development Tools and Libraries"
  dnf install clang
  dnf install boost-devel

To build type `make`.

To run type `./sim --help`.

No install step is provided.
